Please, if you have ideas to improve the plugin, or find bugs, please open issues in
https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-grails3-plugin/issues[Github].

Also, to finish rest support available in production I need your help. I need to create files when
jar / war is generated. So please contact me if you know how to do that in a grails 3 plugin.

Thank you!

You can use your groovy classes as web components and use them in your gsp's.

*This is an incubating feature*

=== Requisites

- You have to define your class from src/main/groovy, not in grails-app.
- grooscript is used to convert the class, so take care with library limitations http://grooscript.org.
- You have to add webcomponents lib if browser don't support it. That library is available in
http://webcomponents.org/ or in the plugin (add with: <asset:javascript src="webcomponents.min.js"/>).

=== Create component class

[source,groovy]
--
package components

class Counter {
    static style = ''' //<1>
        div {
            width: 100px;
        }
    '''
    static renderAfter = ['inc', 'dec'] //<2>
    int value = 0
    void inc() {
        value++
    }
    void dec() {
        value--
    }
    def render() { //<3>
        div {
            h1 value.toString()
            p {
                button(onclick: 'dec', '-') //<4>
                button(onclick: 'inc', '+')
            }
        }
    }
}
--

<1> You can define *style* to apply to the component. It's shadow dom, so not affected by page css.
<2> You can define methods that will execute render when executed with *renderAfter*.
<3> Define the html of your component with a groovy dsl (Groovy template engine).
<4> You can define component methods to execute in onXXX events with the name of the method as a string.

=== Use your component in your gsp's

To use this component in your gsp's you have to use component tag.

[source,html]
--
<grooscript:component src="components.Counter" name="my-counter"/>
--

- *scr* is mandatory, full class name of the component.
- *name* is optional to set the name of the tag to use the component. Some tag names are not allowed,
as counter. If you don't set the name of the tag will use the name of the class without upper case and with
-'s (MyComp -> my-comp)

=== All together

Then you can use your groovy component in your html, as a web component:

[source,html]
--
<html>
<head>
    <asset:javascript src="grooscript-grails.js"/>
    <asset:javascript src="webcomponents.min.js"/>
    <grooscript:component src="components.Counter" name="my-counter"/>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <my-counter></my-counter>
    <my-counter value="3"></my-counter> //<1>
<asset:deferredScripts/>
--

<1> You can set properties of your component. Also you can use content of the tag with a property *content*
available in the groovy class at runtime.

=== Generate components for production

In development, class source is used to convert to javascript. In production source is not available, so
just add grooscript gradle plugin > 1.3.0 that will do that work for you.

=== Helpers

You can access a component by id:

[source,html]
--
<my-counter id="first"></my-counter>
<script>
	GrooscriptGrails.findComponentById("first")
</script>
